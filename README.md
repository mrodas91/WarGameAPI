### Create a MS SQL Server Container in Docker
A docker container is needed in order to storage the service db.
In the terminal run this command: 
- `docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Passw0rd!' -p 1433:1433 --name dockersqledge -d mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge`

### Start WarGameAPI Service
Using your terminal
1. Navigate to WarGameAPI folder path (Inside the folder is a .csproj file).
2. Execute `docker run` to start the service. It, by default, will run in localhost using por 5001 for https and 5000 for http
3. Once the service starts, open your browser and go to https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html to open the API documentation in Swagger.
4. Search for AddPlayer method in the Players secction and Expand.
5. Click on `Try it out` button and **ADD 2 New Player** passing below info in the Request body section :

  "nombre": "Andrew"
}` then click `Execute` button.

You can create as many player you want (2 Player are required).

*Notes: You also can run the game using `dotnet run v` when `v` is the argunt to tell the program to display the initail decks for each player and both decks during each round during the game.*

5. Click on `Try it out` and then click on `Execute`. It will display all matches results.

*Notes: There are other edpoints you can use inside the documentation that works with the playerId and matchId*

## Docker images
Here you will find the docker images from both projects published:
- https://hub.docker.com/search?q=mrodas%20%2F%20war-game-api&type=image

I'm starting with this tecnology. I spent a lot of time traying to orchestrate them but I couldn't connect the API Service to the DB. I got many error realated to 'SQL server service was not found'. So I'm not sure if the images really work but I really enjoyed spending some time using Docker.
